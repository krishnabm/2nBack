2nback is designed to be a brain training tool, focusing specifically on improving fluid intelligence and working memory. At its core, the game challenges players to keep track of sequences of visual and auditory stimuli and identify when a current stimulus matches one from n steps earlier.


## ⚙️ Core Gameplay Mechanics

Visual and Auditory Sequences: Players are presented with a series of visual shapes and sounds. Your task is to remember and identify if the current cue matches the one presented n steps earlier. 

### 👀 Single n-back mode
Keep track of the visual cues and hit the tapper if the current cue matches the cue n turns ago. 

### 👀👂 Dual n-back mode
Here you keep track of two independent cues every round (visual and auditory). Hit the appropriate tapper if either cue matches the one from n turns ago. 

### 👀👂👅 Godlike n-back mode
Will implement when screens become lickable. 


## 📈 Performance Tracking:

You're presented with a graph tracking your session progress after you finish a game.
